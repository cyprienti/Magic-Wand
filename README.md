# 🪄 Magic Wand Gesture Recognition

A gesture recognition system using accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify 3 magic gestures:  
**Stone 🪨**, **Paper 📄**, and **Scissors ✂️** — implemented with a Random Forest classifier.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a machine learning pipeline that:
- Records wand gestures via motion sensors
- Preprocesses and extracts features
- Trains a classifier (Random Forest)
- Predicts the gesture class in real-time

---

## 📦 Features

- 📲 Records motion sensor data (acceleration + gyroscope)
- 📊 Visualizes sensor data over time
- 🧼 Preprocesses and standardizes features
- 🌲 Trains and evaluates a Random Forest model
- 🧙 Live prediction using trained model

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 🔧 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
```

2. 📥 Collect and Save Gesture Recordings
Each recording is saved as a CSV with columns:
time, accX, accY, accZ, gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ

Save recordings to the recordings/ folder. Make sure filenames contain "Stone", "Paper", or "Scissors" to label them correctly.

3. ⚙️ Preprocess Data

```bash
python preprocess.py
```
Extracts mean, std, min, max from all 6 channels

Adds gesture labels

Saves result to features/features.csv

4. 🧠 Train the Classifier
```bash
python train_classifier.py
```
Loads features

Splits data (80% training, 20% test)

Trains Random Forest model

Evaluates performance

Saves random_forest_model.pkl

5. 🔮 Predict on New Gestures
```bash
python yourcode.py
```
Loads a new CSV from recordings/

Extracts features

Predicts the gesture with the trained model

Outputs predicted class (stone/paper/scissors)
